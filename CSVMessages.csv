"message","U02HHHCCF","<!channel>:  Hey, JavaScripters! This is a call for help! I want to do a short 15 minute demo about debugging client-side JavaScript with the Chrome Developer tools at the next Hack + Help, and I was wondering if anybody wanted to help me. Anything would be great, it would be cool to tag-team a demo. \n\nMost of all, I'm all a-flutter about breaking on exceptions and XHR requests. Does anybody have any code snippets that explore exceptions or AJAX? Let me know!!\n\nOh, and if you'd like to do a short interactive lightening talk at Hack + Help that isn't about this topic, please pick one that you'd rather do. Even if it's just ten minutes on some topic, it would be great!","1414094470.000018"
